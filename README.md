Just a small introduction.

Well if you want to see if the code is working or not, 
then each folder have "run.bat" file compling all the code files within the folder 
you will get "filename.exe" for each file. try to open it in your separate command prompt for complete human percivable output.

All the given data files have been arrenged as per avalable on codetantra including its file name.
